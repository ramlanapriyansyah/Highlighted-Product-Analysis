# Project Overview
In this project, we will conduct a comparative analysis between highlighted products and non-highlighted products of a skincare brand. A **highlighted product** refers to a specific product that is featured or promoted during a particular month as part of the brand's marketing strategy. The primary objective is to assess whether these marketing efforts effectively drive increased interest, sales, and brand awareness for the highlighted products compared to non-highlighted products. By evaluating various metrics, we aim to determine the success of the brand's promotional strategies and understand the impact of highlighting specific products on consumer behavior and sales performance.

# Research Questions
1. What was the contribution of the highlighted products to overall revenue and order quantity?
2. How did the highlighted products' month-to-month growth compare?

# Dataset
The dataset consists of the company's sales data from August to October 2024, containing over 150,000 rows of information.

# Data Analysis
All processes, from data extraction to analysis, can be seen in [insert reference here].
## a. Revenue Analysis
The table below shows the results of the Revenue Analysis.

It reveals that the contribution of the highlighted product increased from 3.38% in August to 10.77% in September, before slightly decreasing to 9.25% in October.
In terms of month-to-month growth, the highlighted product revenue shows some fluctuation. It experienced a 262% increase from August to September, followed by a -10.11% decrease from September to October.

## b. Quantity Analysis
The results of the Quantity Analysis are shown in the table below.

Similar to the Revenue Analysis, the contribution of the highlighted product in terms of quantity increased from August to September (2.71% to 6.76%), but then slightly decreased in October (5.75%). 
The same trend is observed in the month-to-month growth. The highlighted product experienced a 208% increase from August to September, followed by a 12.48% decrease from September to October.

# Conclusion
1. The analysis of the highlighted products' contribution to revenue and quantity reveals that marketing efforts had a positive impact, with a significant increase in both metrics from August to September.
2. Despite the strong growth in September, there was a slight decline in the highlighted productâ€™s contribution and month-to-month growth in October.
3. The month-to-month fluctuations in both revenue and quantity highlight the dynamic nature of consumer response, suggesting that while marketing efforts can drive growth, results may vary over time.
4. Overall, the marketing strategy to highlight products showed promising results, but further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind the slight decrease in October and to refine future marketing approaches.

# Recommendations
1. **Consistency in Highlighting Products**: To maintain the momentum of the highlighted products' growth, consider consistently featuring products each month, with slight adjustments to the strategy based on previous performance and customer feedback.
2. **Monitor Performance Closely**: Track month-to-month changes more closely to understand the factors causing fluctuations, especially in the transition from September to October. This could help adjust strategies in real time to optimize results.
3. **Customer Engagement**: Increase customer engagement efforts around highlighted products, such as promotions, social media campaigns, or loyalty incentives, to sustain interest and potentially reduce the fluctuations in growth rates.
